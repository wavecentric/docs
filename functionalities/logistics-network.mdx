The **Logistics Network** functionality provides a comprehensive geographical visualization of your supply chain and operational environment, specifically optimized for regional logistics tracking.

## Interactive Network Visualization
Using advanced mapping technology, the Logistics Network module displays your entire infrastructure in an intuitive interface.

### Infrastructure Nodes
Nodes represent key physical locations in your network, such as:
- **Stations**: Active operational hubs.
- **Terminals**: Logistic transfer points.
- **Rail Connections**: Strategic rail infrastructure points.

Each node is color-coded by type and sized according to its operational importance or capacity.

### Transport Legs
The lines connecting nodes represent the actual transport pathways:
- **Distance Tracking**: View exact distances in kilometers between nodes.
- **Dynamic Animation**: Real-time animations show active "flows" or transport legs, providing a sense of current movement within the network.
- **Leg Type Classification**: Identify different modes of transport or service levels by line styling.

## Contextual Information
Hovering over any node or leg provides detailed metadata:
- **Node Details**: Station type, rail availability, and site descriptions.
- **Leg Details**: Line name, distance, and specific transport type.

## Smart Zoom & Navigation
The map automatically adjusts detail levels based on zoom, showing top-priority hubs at a high level and revealing more granular station data as you dive deeper into specific regions.

<Note>
  The network data is pulled directly from your operational databases, ensuring the visualization always mirrors your real-world infrastructure.
