The **Logistics Network** module provides a high-level, interactive geospatial view of the entire operational environment. It visualizes the active transport nodes, hubs, and the connecting rail or road legs across Europe, enabling operators to instantly assess network reach and density.

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Geospatial Map
The core of this module is a dynamic map of Europe that supports:
- **Pan & Zoom**: Users can roam freely across the map to focus on specific regions (e.g., Northern Italy, Central Europe).
- **Auto-Fit**: On load, the map automatically centers on the active network cluster.
- **Theme Adaptation**: The map's cartography (borders, land mass colors) automatically adjusts to light or dark mode for optimal readability.

### 2. Node Visualization (Hubs & Terminals)
Locations are represented as interactive nodes.
- **Visual Hierachy**: Node size changes dynamically based on importance or "weight" (e.g., volume of traffic).
- **Smart Labeling**: Labels automatically position themselves to avoid overlap and improve clarity.
- **Rich Tooltips**: Hovering over a node reveals:
  - **Station Name** & Description
  - **Rail Availability**: Status of rail connections.
  - **Type**: Operational classification (e.g., Terminal, Hub).

### 3. Network Legs (Connections)
Transport routes connecting the nodes are visualized as lines.
- **Flow Animation**: A subtle particle effect moves along the lines, indicating the direction and active status of the flow.
- **Distance Calculation**: The system automatically calculates and displays the distance (km) for each leg.
- **Leg Details**: Hovering over a line shows the route name, transport type, and exact distance.

## Data Integration

The interactive map is powered by real-time data from the `Public Network API`. This ensures that any change in the physical network—such as a new terminal opening or a route suspension—is immediately reflected in the visualization without requiring frontend code changes.

```json
/* Example Data Structure */
{
  "nodes": [
    { "name": "Verona", "coordinates": [45.438, 10.991], "rail": true },
    { "name": "Munich", "coordinates": [48.135, 11.581], "rail": true }
  ],
  "legs": [
    { "source": "Verona", "target": "Munich", "distance": 430 }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

This tool is primarily used by:
- **Logistics Planners**: To visualize potential routing options and gaps.
- **Sales Teams**: To demonstrate network coverage to prospective clients in real-time.
- **Management**: For operational oversight and strategic planning.
