The **Settings** hub allows you to maintain your professional identity and tailor the AI Loop environment to your specific operational needs.

## Personal Profile
Your profile details provide the necessary context for collaborative logistics orchestration.

### Core Identity
- **Name & Surname**: Maintain your full professional name for clear identification in tasks and inquiries.
- **Contact Details**: Update your email (managed via magic links) and optional phone number.
- **Job Title & Account Type**: Specify your professional role and industry category (e.g., Shipper, Forwarder, Carrier) to optimize platform features.
- **Tax Identification**: Provide your **C.F. (Codice Fiscale)** or relevant tax ID for institutional compliance where required.

### Company & Verification
- **Verified Standing**: Your organization's name is displayed with a **(Verified)** status once authenticated, ensuring trust within the logistics network.
- **Institutional Alignment**: Verified company details are locked to maintain the integrity of the corporate registry.

### Geospatial Context
- **Smart Location Selection**: Powered by Google Maps Autocomplete, this feature ensures high-precision capture of your **Country** and **City**.
- **Visual Validation**: Integrated flag icons for countries provide instant visual confirmation of your regional settings.

## Workspace Customization
Tailor the visual environment to match your professional workflow:
- **Appearance**: Toggle between Light and Dark modes or select high-performance themes (Slate, Rose, Lime).
- **Membership Level**: Instantly identify your access tier (**Admin** vs. **Guest**) within the organization.
