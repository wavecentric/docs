The **Customer Management** module serves as the primary orchestration hub for all business entities interacting with your platform. It provides a high-density overview of your client base, enriched with real-time activity metrics.

## High-Density Directory
Manage your entire business ecosystem through a centralized, searchable table:
- **Intelligent Search**: Rapidly filter customers by **Company Name**, **Domain**, or **Email Address**.
- **CreditSafe Integration**: Seamlessly track and filter by **Creditsafe ID** to maintain financial and institutional compliance.
- **New Customer Onboarding**: Quickly manually add new business partners to your CRM via the streamlined entry portal.

## Engagement & Activity Tracking
The directory uses a sophisticated badge system to provide at-a-glance status updates for every account:
- **Users**: Monitor the number of registered team members associated with each customer organization.
- **Communication**: Identify unread messages or active threads requiring immediate attention.
- **Task Orchestration**: Track pending operational activities linked to specific clients.
- **Inquiry Velocity**: View the volume of active service requests and historical logistics requirements.

## Visual Status Orchestration
Color-coded notification badges (e.g., the red activity counters) allow your team to prioritize outreach based on the urgency of customer needs and the complexity of their current requirements.
