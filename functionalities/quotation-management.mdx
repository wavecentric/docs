## Overview

**Quotation Management** serves as the operational cockpit for the sales and administration teams. It provides a centralized view of all automatically generated offers, allowing for rapid verification and adjustment before transmission to the customer.

## Key Features

### Automated Cost Generation
Upon the creating of an inquiry, the system triggers the **Pricing Engine** logic. This engine instantly calculates a tailor-made offer based on:
*   **Service Type**: Predefined cost structures for specific logistics services.
*   **Inquiry Details**: Specific parameters (origin, destination, cargo type) from the user request.
*   **Route Data**: Optimization data provided by the Route Scanner.

### Dashboard Visibility
The dashboard presents a comprehensive list of all active quotations.
*   **Status Tracking**: Monitors the evolution of offers (e.g., Draft, Verified, Sent).
*   **Quick Actions**: Provides immediate access to View, Edit, and Preview functionalities.

### Verification and Editing
While the initial offer is automated, the platform ensures human oversight.
*   **Edit Option**: Administrators can modify the auto-generated cost structure.
*   **Discounting**: Sales teams can apply specific discounts or adjustments to personalize the final price.
