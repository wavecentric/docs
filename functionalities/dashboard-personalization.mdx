### Advanced Widget UX
- **Intelligent Notifications**: The "Updates" widget features "View-Once" logic, automatically marking specific transient alerts as read just by hovering over them.
- **Rich Interaction**: Widgets support embedded links and deep-linking, allowing you to jump from a notification directly to the relevant record in the Data Lake or Sales Funnel.
- **Live State Updates**: Real-time counters (e.g., in the "Updates" badge) keep you informed without requiring manual page refreshes.
