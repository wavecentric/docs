## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Search & Navigation
Instead of navigating through deep menus, you can simply type what you're looking for. The AI Assistant searches across:
- **Automation Flows**: Find specific routines like "Send Quote" or "Check Shipment Status".
- **Documentation**: Get help with platform features.
- **Data Collections**: Quickly find links to specific databases or reports.

### 2. Conversational Assistance
Beyond searching for flows, the AI Assistant provides real-time answers to logistics queries.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask about shipping routes, regulations, or general logistics advice.
- **Clarification Dialogues**: The assistant can ask follow-up questions to better understand your requirements before suggesting an action.
- **Seamless Transition**: Start a conversation directly from the search bar to refine complex requests.

### 3. Flow Execution
Execute complex backend workflows directly from the search bar through interactive cards:
- **Direct Commands**: Type "Execute [Flow Name]" to trigger a specific automation.
- **Contextual Results**: Results are presented as cards with descriptions, providing immediate clarity on what each automation does (e.g., Quotation Preview, Communication tools, or KPI monitoring).
- **One-Click Access**: Click any result card to trigger the flow or navigate to the relevant section.

### 4. Usage Analytics
The AI Assistant keeps track of your most frequently used flows and actions, positioning your most important tools right where you need them for faster access.
