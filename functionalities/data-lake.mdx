The **Data Lake Manager** is the core data governance tool in WaveCentric. It provides a centralized interface for viewing, filtering, and managing all underlying database collections that power your AI applications and logistics operations.

## Flexible Data Management

The Data Lake is your central repository for creating, managing, and editing all your datasets. You can seamlessly switch between multiple database collections using the high-performance grid.

### Creating a Database
You can bootstrap your data in two ways:
- **Create from Scratch**: Manually define a unique name and initial column headers for a new collection.
- **Import from CSV**: Upload an existing CSV file. The system automatically parses your headers and initializes the database structure based on your file content.

### Secure CRUD Operations
Perform essential data management tasks directly from the UI:
- **Record Entry**: Manually add new rows to your collections using dynamic forms that adapt to your schema.
- **In-line Editing**: Update existing records directly in the table view with real-time field validation.
- **Deletion**: Permanently remove records (requires confirmation).
- **Bulk Export**: Download any collection as a CSV file for external reporting or auditing.

## Technical Governance

### Schema Customization
Maintain the integrity of your data structures as your business evolves:
- **Column Management**: Add, rename, or remove data fields dynamically.
- **Metadata Visibility**: View internal system fields (like unique IDs and timestamps) alongside your business data for technical context.

### Specialized User Profiles
The Data Lake includes a dedicated view for **User Profile Management**, featuring specialized operational fields:
- **Funnel Tracking**: Monitor which stage of the sales pipeline a user is assigned to.
- **Company Verification**: Manage the "Verified" status of organizations within the platform.
- **Permission Mapping**: Directly audit the permissions (Admin vs. Guest) associated with each user record.

### Real-Time Search & Analytics
Data is presented in a high-performance grid optimized for large datasets:
- **Field-Specific Filters**: Search across every column simultaneously to find specific records.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Organize data by any field to identify operational trends or outliers.

<Note>
  The Data Lake is the foundation of WaveCentric's "Intelligence" layer. Changes made here are immediately synchronized with the **AI Assistant** and all automated **Workflows**, ensuring your AI always operates on the most current data.
