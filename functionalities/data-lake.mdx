The **Data Lake Manager** is the core data governance tool in AI Loop. It provides a centralized interface for viewing, filtering, and managing all underlying database collections that power your AI applications and logistics operations.


### Create Database
You can initialize new data structures through two primary methods:

- **New DataBase (Manual)**: Define a custom name and add multiple initial columns manually to build a specialized collection from the ground up.
- **Import from File**: Rapidly ingest existing datasets by uploading **CSV**, **XLSX**, or **XLS** files. The system automatically derives the database name from the filename and initializes the schema based on your file's headers.

### Record Management & Editing
Manage your records with a sophisticated editing suite designed for data integrity:

- **Atomic Row Editing**: Modify individual records through a focus-modal that prevents accidental changes to adjacent data.
- **Helper Intelligence**: The platform detects data types automatically. Typing a date or timestamp triggers a specialized **Date Helper** for easier entry.
- **Data Suggestions**: Field-level intelligence provides contextual suggestions based on existing entries to ensure naming consistency across your dataset.
- **Schema Evolution**: Add new columns to an existing database at any time to accommodate evolving business requirements.

### Search & Filtering
The Data Lake is optimized for rapid analysis of large-scale logistics data:

- **Cross-Column Search**: Instantly find records by searching across any business field simultaneously.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Use field-specific probes to isolate data based on precise criteria.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Integrated **Date-Time Pickers** within the filter headers allow you to perform precise time-based auditing and historical reporting.
- **Bulk Export**: Download any filtered view or entire collection as a CSV for external analysis.
