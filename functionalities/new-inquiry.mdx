The **New Inquiry** wizard facilitates the advanced configuration of complex, multi-service logistics requests through a structured, four-step orchestration process.

## Step 1: Route Selection
Powered by integrated geospatial intelligence, this stage identifies the primary transit points of your shipment:
- **Origin & Destination**: Precise location identification for both pickup and final delivery.
- **Stop-over (Optional)**: Inclusion of transit hubs or secondary collection points.
- **Visual Mapping**: Real-time geospatial visualization of the selected logistics path.

## Step 2: Choose Your Path
Review and select from multiple calculated logistics routes:
- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: The system evaluates available paths across **Rail**, **Road**, **Sea**, and **Air**.
- **Route Summary**: View distance metrics and transport legs for each possible orchestration path.

## Step 3: Select Service Type
Define the operational parameters of the transport:
- **Service Categories**: Select from **Door-to-Door**, **Door-to-Terminal**, **Terminal-to-Door**, or **Terminal-to-Terminal**.
- **Terminal Handling**: Configure specific handling requirements at origin or destination hubs based on the selected service category.

## Step 4: Specify Units & Goods
Input granular technical data to finalize the logistics requirement:
- **Loading Unit Specification**: Define intermodal units, including type, size, quantity, and weight.
- **Cargo Specifications**: Capture specialized data such as **NHM Codes**, **Dangerous Goods (ADR/UN)**, or **Waste (CER)**.
- **Handling Constraints**: Specify constraints like **Craneability** or specific temperature requirements.

## Multi-Service Orchestration
The wizard supports high-density inquiries by allowing users to add multiple distinct service requests (the "basket" approach) before final submission. This ensures that complex global supply chain requirements are captured within a single, unified inquiry ID.
