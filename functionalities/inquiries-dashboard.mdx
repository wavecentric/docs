## Unified Inquiry Management
Consolidate requests from disparate channels into a standardized operational flow:
- **Multichannel Identification**: Instant visual indicators distinguish inquiries originating via **Email**, **Phone**, or **Electronic Form**.
- **Real-time Status Synchronization**: The dashboard updates instantly, ensuring all operational changes are visible to authorized users.

## Precision Data Navigation

### Advanced Filtering & Search
Manage large volumes of logistics data with granular control:
- **Global Search Engine**: Locate specific records using Inquiry IDs, sender identities, or corporate names.
- **Categorical Filtering**: Isolate requests by **Funnel Stage** (e.g., Lead, Qualified), **Operational Status** (e.g., Open, Pending), or specific **Business Partners**.
- **Channel-Specific Views**: Focus on specific communication streams to optimize response workflows.

### Dynamic Workflow Execution
Modify operational parameters directly within the interface:
- **Inline Orchestration**: Update funnel stages and internal statuses via integrated dropdown menus.
- **Persistent State Sharing**: URL synchronization allows for the sharing of specific filtered views by simply copying the browser address.

## Intelligence Layers

### Corporate & User Intelligence
Access deep-level metadata without navigating away from the dashboard:
- **User Information Modal**: Clicking a sender's name reveals professional contact details, job title, account type, and verified geographic location.
- **Embedded User Summary**: A quick-access popover within the inquiry record provides an immediate snapshot of the requester's corporate context.
- **Automated Business Reporting**: Selecting a customer name triggers the `Centrico Customer View` flow, generating a real-time intelligence report based on aggregated platform data.

### Detailed Service View
Opening a specific inquiry record provides a 360-degree view of the technical requirements:
- **Journey Orchestration**: Visual mapping of the logistics route, including origin, destination, total distance, and terminal handling requirements.
- **Technical Cargo Specifications**: Captured data for specialized transport, including **NHM Codes**, **ADR Classes** (Dangerous Goods), **UN Codes**, and **CER Codes** (Waste).
- **Unit Configuration**: Detailed breakdown of shipping units, including type, size, weight, and constraints like **Craneability**.

## Inquiry Creation

Authorized users can initiate new service requests directly from the dashboard using three specialized entry points:

- **Ask Inquiry (AI Assistant)**: Engage with a conversational AI interface to draft complex logistics requests through natural language.
- **Draft Request**: A streamlined form for quickly capturing essential contact information and a brief message to initiate the inquiry process without a full route specification.
- **New Inquiry (Enhanced)**: A comprehensive, multi-step orchestration wizard for detailed logistics planning:
    1. **Route Selection**: Geospatial mapping to identify origin, destination, and stopover points.
    2. **Path Identification**: Review and select from multiple calculated logistics routes.
    3. **Service Configuration**: Define service types (Door-to-Door, Terminal-to-Terminal) and specific terminal handling needs.
    4. **Technical Specification**: Input granular cargo data, intermodal unit details, and loading constraints.
