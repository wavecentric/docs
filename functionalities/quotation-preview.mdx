## Overview

**Quotation Preview** is the final stage in the offer generation workflow. It renders the verified data into a professional, customer-facing template, ensuring accuracy and brand consistency before the offer leaves the platform.

## Key Features

### Template Rendering
The system dynamically populates a standardized quotation template with the specific details of the inquiry.
*   **Dynamic Content**: Incorporates customer details, service specifications, and the final pricing structure.
*   **Professional Formatting**: Ensures every offer looks uniform and professional, regardless of the user creating it.

### One-Click Transmission
Once the preview is verified, the offer can be sent immediately.
*   **Send Action**: A single click triggers the transmission of the offer to the customer via their preferred channel.
*   **Flow Integration**: This action completes the "Quotation Management" workflow and updates the status in the central dashboard.
