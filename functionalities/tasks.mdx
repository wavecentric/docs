The **Task Management** system is a powerful coordination tool that ensures inquiry follow-up is never missed. It provides a shared workspace with flexible visualization.

## Strategic Task Management

### Inline Task Creation
Generate new operational tasks directly within the high-density list view or Kanban board to maintain workflow momentum:
- **Comprehensive Data Entry**: Define task **Subjects** and detailed **Descriptions** to provide full context to assignees.
- **Precision Categorization**: Assign specific task **Types** (e.g., Internal, Customer, Supplier, Email, Service-Request, Follow-up, Call, Meeting).
- **Entitiy Linking**: Associate tasks with specific **Business Partners** or **Customers** directly during creation.
- **Deadline Orchestration**: Utilize the integrated calendar component to set precise operational deadlines.

## Three Dimensions of Productivity

### 1. High-Density List View
For rapid data entry and bulk management:
- **Inline Editing**: Update assignees, task types, linked customers, and statuses directly from the table.
- **Granular Sorting**: Organize your organization's workload by subject, deadline, or priority.
- **Status Orchestration**: Manage tasks through defined lifecycles including **TODO**, **IN PROGRESS**, **ON HOLD**, and **DONE**.

### 2. The Kanban Board
The Kanban view transforms your task list into a visual pipeline, perfect for managing high-volume operations:
- **Drag-and-Drop Workflow**: Instantly update task status by dragging cards between columns.
- **Visual Oversight**: Monitor the distribution of tasks across **TODO**, **DONE**, **ON HOLD**, and **IN PROGRESS** stages.
- **Column-Specific Actions**: Use the **(+)** button in any column to quickly add a task to that specific workflow stage.
