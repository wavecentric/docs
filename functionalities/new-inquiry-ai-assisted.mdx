The **AI Assisted Inquiry** feature uses advanced natural language processing to help you draft and categorize incoming requests faster than manual entry.

## Conversational Logistics Assistant
The **AI Assisted Inquiry** (Ask AI) interface transforms unstructured text into structured logistics data. It allows you to create complex inquiries using plain, natural language—much like having a conversation with a logistics expert.

### How It Works
- **Natural Language Input**: Simply describe what you need to ship, from where, and to where. You can be as specific or as general as you like (e.g., *"I need to move 20 tons of steel from Trieste to Frankfurt next Tuesday"*).
- **Intelligent Extraction**: The AI automatically identifies core details:
    - Origin & Destination
    - Cargo Type & Weight
    - Urgency & Timing
- **Interactive Clarification**: If the AI is missing information needed for a precise quote, it will ask follow-up questions to fill in the gaps.

### Sample Scenarios
The AI is pre-trained on various logistics scenarios, including:
- **Live Animal Transport**: Handling specific permits and requirements.
- **Hazardous Materials**: Identifying ADR classes and UN codes from text.
- **Temperature-Controlled Cargo**: Managing refrigerated transport needs.
- **Express Deliveries**: Prioritizing time-critical shipments.

## Key Interface Features
- **Prompt Library**: Use one-click sample prompts to quickly start common logistics requests.
- **Session Management**: Conversations are preserved, allowing you to return and complete an inquiry later without losing progress.
- **Instant Reference**: Once a request is finalized, the system immediately provides a unique submission reference ID.
