**System Notifications** provides a centralized activity feed displaying all important operations and events across the application. Users receive personalized updates about database changes, communications, and system activities in a familiar social media-style interface.

## What It Does

The notification system automatically creates activity entries for all operations that modify the database or trigger important events. This includes:

- Database table and field management (create, update, delete)
- Email communications (sent, received, replied)
- Customer interactions (new quotes, service requests)
- User invitations and team changes
- Task assignments and updates
- CreditSafe report generations
- System-wide administrative actions

Each notification is stored in `db_ai-loop_System_Notifications` and displayed on the user's home page feed.

## Notification Types

### View Once
Informational updates about routine activities:
- "New table created in datalake"
- "Column added to customer database"
- "Row updated in tasks collection"

**Interaction**: Automatically marked as read when the user hovers over the notification.

### Accept Once
Important events requiring user acknowledgment:
- "Customer email received - requires response"
- "New service request submitted"
- "Task deadline approaching"

**Interaction**: Requires explicit action via "Okay, Got it!" button to mark as read.

## Feed Interface

The notification feed displays on the home page with a LinkedIn/Facebook-style layout:

### Feed Structure
Each notification shows:
- **Title**: Bold, attention-grabbing summary with emojis
- **Message**: Detailed description with relevant data and links
- **Timestamp**: Relative time ("5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago")
- **Action Button**: "Okay, Got it!" for `accept_once` notifications

### Display Logic
- Shows all notifications where `read: "no"` for the current user's email
- Sorted by timestamp (most recent first)
- Updates in real-time as new notifications arrive

## Dual Notification System

For database operations, the system creates **two notifications**:

1. **User Confirmation**: Sent to the person who performed the action
   - Confirms successful completion
   - Includes summary of changes made
   - Links to view updated data

2. **Admin Alerts**: Sent to all admin team members with `receive_notifications: yes`
   - Details the operation and user who performed it
   - Provides context and change details
   - Enables oversight and audit trail

## How It Works

### Notification Creation
When a database operation or important event occurs:

1. **Event Trigger**: System detects the operation (webhook, API call, or internal action)
2. **User Lookup**: Identifies relevant recipients based on email and team settings
3. **Message Generation**: Creates personalized title and HTML-formatted message
4. **Database Insert**: Stores notification in `db_ai-loop_System_Notifications`
5. **Feed Display**: Notification appears immediately in user's feed

### Notification Dismissal

**View Once (Hover to Dismiss)**:
- User hovers mouse over the notification
- System makes API request to update `read: "yes"`
- Notification removed from feed instantly

**Accept Once (Click to Dismiss)**:
- User clicks "Okay, Got it!" button
- API request updates `read: "yes"`
- Confirmation animation before removal
