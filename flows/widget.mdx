**Dashboard Widget** provides a comprehensive data snapshot for users when they load the application. It combines multiple data sources into a single response, delivering everything needed for a personalized homepage experience.

## What It Does

When triggered with a user's IP address and email, the widget retrieves and combines:

- **Local Weather**: Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise/sunset times based on IP geolocation

- **AI Configuration**: Available AI assistant tools and settings

### Tasks Summary

### Notifications
