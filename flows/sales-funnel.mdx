- **Lead**: Initial contact or inquiry
- **Qualified Lead**: Leads identified as a fit for your services
- **Proposal**: Active service offer and pricing submission
- **Negotiation**: Review and refinement of the proposal details
- **Contract Sent**: Formal agreement awaiting final authorization
- **Closed**: The finalization of the negotiation process
- **Won**: Successful conversion and commencement of the partnership

- **Communication History**: View all past messages and interactions with a specific lead
- **Task Overview**: See all open and completed tasks associated with the account
