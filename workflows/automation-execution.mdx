The Application allows the frontend to trigger Activepieces workflows securely via a proxy endpoint.

## Architecture

The `execute-command` endpoint acts as a secure bridge between the User Interface and the Activepieces automation engine.

<ParamField path="flowId" type="string" required>
  The Activepieces Flow ID to trigger.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="command" type="string" required>
  A descriptive action name (e.g., "Sync ERP").
</ParamField>

## Context Injection

The server automatically injects the authenticated user's context into the webhook payload:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "admin",
    "companyName": "Acme Logistics"
  }
}
```
