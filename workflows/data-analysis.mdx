# CC-M04 - Analisi Avanzata dei Dati Relativi ai Clienti

The **CC-M04 - Advanced Analysis of Customer-Related Data** tool, found in the CENTRICO module, provides a high-level analysis of your business contacts, distinguishing between clients (`Cliente`) and suppliers (`Fornitore`). It can generate a visual report or provide distinct lists for each category.

This tool offers three primary functions:

1.  **View**
2.  **List of Cliente**
3.  **List of Fornitore**

---

## 1. View

This is the main analytical function, which generates a visual report summarizing the composition of your contacts.

<Callout>
  **Description:** To View the cliente, Fornitore and non definito (To view the client, supplier, and undefined contacts).
</Callout>

### Analysis Report (Rapporto di analisi)

When you select **View** and click **Run**, the system generates an "Rapporto di analisi" (Analysis Report). This report includes:

*   **A Pie Chart:** Visually represents the proportion of contacts categorized as clients versus those categorized as suppliers.
*   **A Legend:**
    *   **Blue:** Represents **Cliente** (Client)
    *   **Green:** Represents **Fornitore** (Supplier)

This provides a quick, at-a-glance understanding of your contact database distribution.
