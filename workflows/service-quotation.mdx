# Service Quotation

The Service Quotation module is a streamlined tool for managing the entire lifecycle of a customer quote. It allows you to create a draft, review it, and send the final quotation to the client, all from a single interface.

The process is divided into three main actions:
1.  **Draft a Quote**
2.  **Show Quotation**
3.  **Send Quotation**

## 1. Draft a Quote

This is the first step in the quotation process. You will provide all the necessary details to generate a draft document.

## 2. Show Quotation

After creating a draft, Quote_id allows you to preview the final, formatted quotation. It's a crucial step for reviewing all the details for accuracy before it's sent to the client.
