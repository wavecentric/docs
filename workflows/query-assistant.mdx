###  Query Assistant

The Query Assistant is a powerful, AI-driven tool that allows you to interact with the AI LooP platform using natural language. You can submit questions to retrieve information from internal systems like the **Data Lake** or initiate complex **flows** (workflows) without navigating through multiple menus.



The core function is to **Ask a Query**. You submit a question to the advanced AI and receive a clear, insightful response tailored to your request.

#### How to Use the Query Assistant

1.  From the dashboard, click on the **Query Assistant** module.
2.  The "Ask Query" tab will be selected by default.
3.  In the **Ask your query `*`** text box, type your question or command in plain English. This is a mandatory field.
4.  Click the **Run** button to submit your query.
5.  The AI will process your request and return the information or confirm the action taken.
