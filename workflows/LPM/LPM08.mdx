## 1. Overview

**Document Management and Historical Preservation** ensures the integrity and traceability of all procurement records. This deliverable addresses the need to "manage documents relating to offers and requests, keeping historical versions in a secure and orderly way for future consultation or verification." By centralizing document generation and storage, the system provides a robust audit trail and ensures commercial accountability.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **Digital Records & Audit Trail** layer. It ensures:
*   **Centralized Repository**: Secure storage of all generated offers and incoming requests.
*   **Version Control**: Tracking of historical iterations of quotes and contracts.
*   **Instant Retrieval**: Rapid access to past documents for verification or duplication.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements "Document Management and Historical Preservation" through the **Quotation History Archive** and **Document Generation Engine**.

### Offer Document Management
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Manage documents relating to offers"*

The system automatically generates and manages professional offer documents:
*   **Automated Generation**: Creates standardized PDF offers from calculated data, ensuring format consistency.
*   **Digital Storage**: Stores the generated document directly associated with the Quote ID.
*   **Download & Share**: Enables immediate retrieval of the official offer document for distribution or filing.

### Historical Versioning & Traceability
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Keeping historical versions... for future consultation"*

The platform maintains a complete chronological record of all procurement activities:
*   **Unique Identification**: Every request and offer is assigned a unique Quote ID (e.g., `IN_16022026_949.46`), serving as the primary key for historical retrieval.
*   **Status History**: Tracks the lifecycle of a document from "Received" to "Cost Calculated" to "Sent", preserving the context of each version.
*   **Centralized Archive**: A searchable list view provides access to all past and present requests, acting as the historical database for the department.

### Secure Verification
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Secure and orderly way for... verification"*

The system ensures document integrity for verification purposes:
*   **Immutable Records**: Once an offer is finalized and sent, the record acts as a snapshot of the commercial terms at that point in time.
*   **Audit Trail**: The "Run" and "View" actions provide traceability of who accessed or processed a specific document.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### Document Engine
*   **PDF Generator**: Service responsible for rendering the detailed offer document from the structured data.
*   **Storage**: Secure Data storage for the generated document files, linked to the database records.

### Archival System
*   **History Log**: Database collection acting as the ledger for all quotation records.
*   **Search Index**: Allows users to filter and find historical documents based on ID, Customer, or Status.
