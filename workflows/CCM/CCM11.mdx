## 1. Overview

Service Performance Monitoring provides the operational pulse of the platform. It fulfills the requirement to "monitor service performance in real-time", enabling the business not only to react to issues but to proactively identify inefficiencies in both customer management and procurement processes.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **efficiency optimization** layer. It ensures:
*   **Operational Visibility**: Instant insight into the volume and status of ongoing service requests.
*   **Process Health**: Identifying bottlenecks by tracking "Open Tasks" and conversion rates.
*   **Strategic Alignment**: Using data to align procurement strategies with actual customer demand patterns.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements the following functionalities to fulfill the "service performance monitoring" requirement.

### Real-time Operational Metrics
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Monitor service performance in real time"*

The **Analytics & Reports** dashboard serves as the central monitoring station:
*   **Throughput Tracking**: The **Leads** and **Annual Revenue** KPIs provide a real-time gauge of business volume and financial performance.
*   **Efficiency Indicators**: The **Success Rate** metric highlights the effectiveness of the commercial team in converting inquiries to contracts.

    Refer: [Analytics & Reports](/functionalities/analytics-reports)

### Optimization Intelligence
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Identify any areas for improvement... in procurement"*

By visualizing data spatially and temporally, the system highlights inefficiencies:
*   **Demand Heatmaps**: The **Customer Locations** map reveals geographic clusters of high activity, allowing for optimized procurement of carrier capacity in those regions.
*   **Bottleneck Detection**: The **Open Tasks** metric identifies backlogs in the execution pipeline, signaling areas where resource allocation needs improvement.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### Streaming Analytics
*   **`StreamProcessor`**: A backend component that ingests events (e.g., "Inquiry Created", "Task Completed") in real-time.
*   **Aggregation Pipeline**: Pre-calculates performance metrics every 60 seconds to ensure dashboard dashboards are always reflective of the current state.

## 5. Evidence of Delivery

The following evidence demonstrates strict compliance with the CCM 11 requirement:

| Capability | Verification Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Performance Monitoring** | **Evidenced by [KPI Dashboard]**: The live metrics for Revenue, Leads, and Success Rate prove the system's ability to track core service performance. |
| **Inefficiency Detection** | **Evidenced by [Open Tasks Counter]**: The explicit tracking of pending tasks allows management to instantly identify operational bottlenecks. |
| **Procurement Optimization** | **Evidenced by [Geographic Intelligence]**: The ability to match demand (Inquiries) with supply (Network Map) allows for data-driven procurement strategies. |
