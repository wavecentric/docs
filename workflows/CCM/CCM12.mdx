## 1. Overview

**Event and Resource Management with Customers** ensures efficient planning and adherence to deadlines. It fulfills the requirement to "manage events and customer-related resources... with advanced scheduling" by utilizing the platform's unified Task Management engine to orchestrate all operational activities.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **Operational Execution** layer. It ensures:
*   **Resource Allocation**: Assigning specific logistics tasks or meetings to internal agents.
*   **Deadline Adherence**: Ensuring appointments and milestones are tracked with precise due dates.
*   **Synchronization**: Keeping operational tasks aligned with customer communication channels.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements "Event and Resource Management" through the existing **Tasks** functionality, tailored for diverse operational contexts.

### Integrated Event Scheduling
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Manage events... appointments, or logistics tasks"*

The platform treats every customer interaction as a time-bound operational event.
*   **Precision Categorization**: The system allows for the creation of specific task types including **Meetings**, **Calls**, and **Logistics Operations**.
*   **Entity Linking**: Every event is directly linked to a specific **Business Partner** or **Customer**, ensuring full context availability.

### Resource Synchronization
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Advanced scheduling and synchronization"*

The system ensures that resources (Agents) and Events (Tasks) remain synchronized through a visualized pipeline:
*   **Unified Execution Queue**: All events, regardless of origin, land in a centralized board.
*   **Real-Time Assignment**: Managers can dynamically reassign tasks via drag-and-drop to balance workload and ensure resource availability matches event demand.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### Universal Task Schema
*   **Polymorphic Design**: The `Tasks` entity is designed to represent any time-bound event, enabling the seamless scheduling of diverse activities within a single schema.

## 5. Evidence of Delivery

The following evidence demonstrates strict compliance with the CCM 12 requirement:

| Capability | Verification Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Event Management** | **Evidenced by [Task Categorization]**: The ability to strictly categorize items as "Meetings", "Calls", or "Tasks" (as shown in the creation interface) proves the event management capability. |
| **Scheduling** | **Evidenced by [Deadline Logic]**: The "Deadline" field inherent in every task provides the advanced scheduling mechanism required. |
| **Synchronization** | **Evidenced by [Unified Pipeline]**: The consolidation of all customer-related activities into a single Kanban view demonstrates the synchronization of resources against demand. |
