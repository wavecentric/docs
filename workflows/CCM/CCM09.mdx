## 1. Overview

**Sensitive Data Management and Privacy** guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of the sensitive information processed by the platform. In compliance with strict regulations such as GDPR, the system implements a "Privacy by Design" architecture, ensuring that data protection is not an afterthought but a core capability of the infrastructure.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **security and compliance** layer. It ensures:
*   **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to GDPR standards for data handling and the "Right to be Forgotten."
*   **Data Sovereignty**: Mechanisms to control where and how data is stored.
*   **Consent Management**: Explicit tracking of user permissions for data processing.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements the following functionalities to fulfill the "protection of sensitive customer data" requirement.

### Encryption Framework
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Encryption... mechanisms"*

Data security is enforced through cryptographic standards:
*   **Encryption at Rest**: All databases (e.g., `db_ai-loop_CRM_Inquiries`) are encrypted using AES-256 standards on disk.
*   **Encryption in Transit**: All API communication is secured via TLS 1.3, ensuring no data can be intercepted during transmission.
*   **Key Management**: Utilizing secure cloud-based Key Management Systems (KMS) for rotating cryptographic keys.

### Compliance & Consent
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Consent management"*

The system includes mechanisms to respect user privacy:
*   **Audit Logging**: Every access to sensitive customer records is logged in an immutable audit trail.
*   **Data Anonymization**: Capabilities to anonymize or delete user data upon request to satisfy "Right to be Forgotten" mandates.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### Security Infrastructure
*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Strict permission boundaries ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive fields.
*   **Field-Level Encryption**: Highly sensitive fields (e.g., personal identifiers) can be encrypted at the application level before storage.

## 5. Evidence of Delivery

The following evidence demonstrates strict compliance with the CCM 09 requirement through foundational infrastructure capabilities:

| Capability | Verification Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Protection** | **Evidenced by [Security Infrastructure]**: The implementation of TLS 1.3 and AES-256 encryption ensures data is protected against unauthorized access. |
| **Compliance** | **Evidenced by [Audit Logs]**: System logs recording access attempts serve as proof of monitoring and accountability mechanisms. |
| **Access Control** | **Evidenced by [RBAC Settings]**: The configuration of user roles restricts access to sensitive data based on strict "need-to-know" principles. |
