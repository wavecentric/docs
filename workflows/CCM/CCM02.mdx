## 1. Overview

**CCM 02 Automating Custom Offer Creation** enables the system to generate immediate, personalized value propositions for customers. This deliverable minimizes the latency between inquiry and quote by leveraging automated logic to construct tailor-made offers. It provides a structured lifecycle for these offers from automated creation to human verification and monitoring ensuring speed without sacrificing accuracy or personalization.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **automated commercial lifecycle**. It ensures:
*   **Tailor-made Generation**: Every offer is uniquely constructed based on the specific parameters of the customer's request (service type, route, cargo).
*   **Evolution Monitoring**: The platform provides a mechanism to track the status of an offer from "Draft" (Auto-generated) to "Verified" (Human-checked) to "Sent".
*   **Response Speed**: The system replaces manual calculation with instant "Predefined Cost" logic, allowing for rapid commercial response.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The following functionalities fulfill the requirements of CCM 02, mapping directly to the "automatically generate tailor-made offers" intent.

### Automated Cost Construction
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Automatically generate tailor-made offers"*

The platform implements an automated commercial engine that triggers immediately upon inquiry creation (`flow=quotation-management`).
*   **Logic-Based Pricing**: The system applies predefined cost logic to the specific inquiry details (e.g., Distance × Rate + Service Fee).
*   **Instant Draft**: A draft quotation is created without human intervention, populated with a calculated "Predefined Cost".

### Quotation Management Dashboard
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Monitoring the evolution of the offers"*

The **Quotation Management** interface provides the operational view for tracking offer lifecycle.
*   **Status Tracking**: Admin and Sales teams can view the real-time status of all generated offers.
*   **Verification & Editing**: Offers can be opened, reviewed, and adjusted (e.g., applying discounts) before finalization.

### Template-Based Personalization
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Personalizing customer response"*

The **Quotation Preview** module ensures that the final output is both standardized and personalized.
*   **Dynamic Template Rendering**: The system generates a professional document (PDF/HTML) using the existing template but populating it with the specific inquiry details.
*   **One-Click Transmission**: Verified offers are sent immediately via the "Send" action, triggering the dispatch flow.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through a tightly integrated technical architecture:

### Pricing Engine & Logic
*   **Calculation Logic**: Backend algorithms utilize `service_id` and `route_data` to computate base costs.
*   **Flow Orchestration**: The `quotation-management` flow orchestrates the passing of data from the Inquiry service to the Pricing service.

### APIs
*   **`GET /api/v1/flows?flow=quotation-management&command=view-request`**: Retrives the specific inquiry and its calculated offer data for verification.
*   **`POST /api/v1/quotation/send`**: Triggers the final transmission of the verified offer.

### UI Components
*   **Quotation Dashboard**: Grid view for monitoring offer status.
*   **Preview Modal**: Visual component for rendering the final customer-facing document.
