## 1. Overview

***Automation of Notification of Deadlines and Contract Changes*** serves as the proactive nervous system of the platform. It ensures that "no detail is forgotten" by automating the supervision of critical dates and events. Instead of passive monitoring, the system actively pushes notifications to users regarding expirations, renewals, and status changes.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **automated alerting infrastructure**. It ensures:
*   **Deadline Safety**: Active warnings before deadlines (expirations/renewals) occur.
*   **Change Awareness**: Instant notifications when the status of a contract approval changes.
*   **Efficiency**: Removing the need for manual "checking" of dates.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements the following functionalities to fulfill the "automatic notifications" requirement.

### Proactive Deadline Alerts
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Automatic notifications for contract expirations"*

As demonstrated in CCM 03, the **Task Manager Bot** acts as the automated guardian of deadlines.
*   **Automated Scanning**: The bot continuously scans the `db_ai-loop_V3_Tasks` database for impending dates.
*   **Push Notifications**: When a deadline approaches (e.g., Contract Renewal), the system triggers a direct alert to the assignee.

    Refer: [CCM 03 - Contract Monitoring](/workflows/CCM03)

### Status Change Notifications
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Notifications for... approvals"*

The platform's event-driven architecture ensures that status transitions trigger updates.
*   **Approval Flows**: When a contract or offer is moved to "Approved" or "Verified," the relevant stakeholders are automatically notified.
*   **Task Updates**: Changes to a task's status (e.g., TODO -> DONE) trigger notifications to the task owner/watcher.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### Notification Services
*   **`Task Manager Bot` Agent**: The autonomous logic responsible for time-based triggers.
*   **Notification Dispatcher**: The centralized service that routes alerts to the user's preferred interface (In-app, Email, etc.).

## 5. Evidence of Delivery

The following evidence demonstrates strict compliance with the CCM 07 requirement:

| Capability | Verification Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Expiration Alerts** | **Evidenced by [Task Manager Bot]**: The `taskreminder.png` evidence shows a specific automated alert ("Reminder: Contract Renewal"), proving the system's ability to notify regarding expirations. |
| **Change Notifications** | **Evidenced by [Task Dashboard]**: Use of the "Activity Log" and status flags provides visual indicators of changes and approvals. |
