The **Data Viewer** is a versatile tool within AI Loop that allows you to extract and format database information. You can choose to view the data as a user-friendly HTML report or as a raw CSV file, with options to receive the output via email.

The Data Viewer provides two primary output formats:

1.  **View in HTML**
2.  **View in CSV**
