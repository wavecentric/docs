## 1. Overview

**Historical Data Management** provides the longitudinal view of the logistics operations. It fulfills the requirement to "access and analyze historical data from logistics operations to understand trends and improve future planning."

This capability is useful for **making decisions based on historical data and optimizing long-term logistics**.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **Strategic Planning & Auditing** layer. It ensures:
*   **Trend Analysis**: identifying seasonal patterns and long-term volume shifts.
*   **Operational Auditing**: Full traceability of past transport requests for dispute resolution and quality assurance.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Using past performance data to refine future route planning and carrier selection.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements "Historical Data Management" through the **Data Lake Manager**, specifically preserving the entire lifecycle of valid logistical requests.

### Permanent Archives
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Access... historical data"*

The system automatically archives every processed request into a dedicated historical database.
*   **V3_Requests**: This specific collection acts as the permanent ledger for all logistics inquiries, quotes, and executed transport orders.
*   **Immutable History**: Once a request is finalized, its data is preserved for future analysis, ensuring a stable baseline for reporting.

### Temporal Analysis Tools
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Understand trends"*

The Data Lake interface provides specific tools for navigating through time:
*   **Date-Time Pickers**: Filter records by specific time ranges (e.g., "Last Q4" or "2023 Fiscal Year") to isolate relevant historical segments.
*   **Trend Visualization**: Export filtered historical datasets to BI tools to visualize growth trends and performance shifts over time.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### V3_Requests Collection
*   **Structured Storage**: The `V3_Requests` database is optimized for long-term storage, indexing key fields like Date, Origin, Destination, and Cargo Type for rapid historical retrieval.
*   **Direct Access Link**: Authorized users can access the raw historical data directly via the Data Lake deep link: `https://ai-loop.alpeadria.com/ai-loop/datalake?db=V3_Requests`

## 5. Evidence of Delivery

The following evidence demonstrates strict compliance with the MCD 07 requirement:

| Capability | Verification Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Historical Access** | **Evidenced by [V3_Requests]**: The existence of the dedicated `V3_Requests` database (accessible via the link above) proves the system retains operational history. |
| **Trend Analysis** | **Evidenced by [Temporal Filters]**: The ability to filter this database by date ranges (shown in the image) demonstrates the tooling necessary to analyze trends over specific periods. |
