## 1. Overview

**Integration with Existing Systems** ensures that the platform doesn't operate in a vacuum but serves as a converging point for the enterprise's data. It fulfills the requirement to "integrate the module with existing systems to ensure centralized and fluid management of customer and contract data."

This capability is necessary to **avoid data duplication and ensure consistency across business systems**, acting as the single source of truth.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this deliverable covers the **Data Interoperability & Governance** layer. It ensures:
*   **Centralized Repository**: Hosting data from disparate legacy systems in a single, modern environment.
*   **Data Consistency**: Eliminating synchronization errors by maintaining a master record of customers and contracts.
*   **Fluid Management**: Allowing seamless read/write operations on imported data without technical barriers.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements "Integration" through the **Data Lake Manager**, which is designed to ingest and standardize external data.

### Unified Data Ingestion
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Integrate with existing systems"*

The Data Lake provides robust tools for migrating data from external systems into the platform:
*   **Universal Import**: supporting **CSV**, **XLSX**, and **XLS** formats to rapidly ingest data.
*   **Auto-Schema Detection**: The system automatically reads the structure of external files and creates the corresponding database schema, reducing integration time to seconds.

### Centralized Data Governance
**Requirement Addressed**: *"Centralized and fluid management"*

Once integrated, the data becomes a first-class citizen in the ecosystem:
*   **Unified Editing**: Users can manage imported contracts and customer details using the platform's modern UI, bypassing clunky legacy interfaces.
*   **Cross-System Consistency**: By centralizing edits in the Data Lake, the organization maintains a single, consistent version of the truth.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### Data Lake Architecture
*   **Schema Agnostic Storage**: The Data Lake is built to handle dynamic schemas, meaning it can adapt to the structure of any "existing system" without requiring code changes.
*   **Interoperabilty Layer**: The file import engine acts as a bridge, translating static exports into active, queryable database collections.

## 5. Evidence of Delivery

The following evidence demonstrates strict compliance with the MCD 06 requirement:

| Capability | Verification Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **System Integration** | **Evidenced by [File Ingestion]**: The ability to upload and parse external files (CSV/Excel) proves the specific capability to integrate data from existing external systems. |
| **Centralized Management** | **Evidenced by [Unified Interface]**: The Data Lake interface (shown above) demonstrates that once data is imported, it is managed centrally with fluid tools (search, filter, edit). |
