The **Quotation** module streamlines the process of calculating costs and presenting commercial offers to customers.

## Management Workflow

Quotation management allows commercial teams to handle high volumes of price requests with precision.

- **Request Tracking**: Monitor all inbound quote requests and their status.
- **Cost Calculation**: Automated calculation based on the designed network in the Orchestrator.
- **Approval Workflow**: Ensure quotes meet margin requirements before being sent.

Professional presentation is key to conversion. CENTRICO allows for instant preview and generation of PDF quotes.

### Features
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Apply customer-specific discounts or surcharges based on contract data.
- **Service Breakdown**: Provide clear visibility into the different legs of a multimodal journey (e.g., Trucking → Rail → Terminal).
- **Interactive Previews**: Review the quote exactly as the customer will see it before sending.
