## Operational Philosophy

CENTRICO operates on the principle of **Connected Intelligence**. By integrating financial data (CreditSafe), operational data (MAGEMO), and communication flows, it provides a 360-degree view of the commercial pipeline.

### Integration with MAGEMO
While CENTRICO handles the "Commercial" side of the business (Whom are we working with? What are they asking? What is the price?), it is seamlessly integrated with **MAGEMO**, which handles the "Execution" (How are we moving the goods? Where is the train?).

## Architecture Overview

The platform is designed to be highly modular, allowing for:
- **API-First Design**: Easy integration with external data sources like CreditSafe.
- **AI-Powered Workflows**: Natural language processing for automated inquiry extraction.
- **Dynamic Networking**: Real-time network mapping that reflects current physical constraints.
