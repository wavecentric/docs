The **Inquiry Management** system is where commercial teams process and respond to service requests from customers and prospects.

## Inquiry Dashboard

The dashboard provides a high-level view of all active inquiries, sorted by urgency and status.

- **Status Tracking**: Monitor inquiries through their lifecycle (New, In Progress, Quoted, Closed).
- **Fast Filtering**: Search by customer identity, origin/destination nodes, or equipment requirements.
- **Assigned Agents**: See which commercial representative is handling each request.

## Intelligent Data Extraction

When an inquiry is created (manually or via email), the system uses AI to extract key operational parameters:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Origin (POL)** | The Point of Loading (e.g., Terminal, Port, or Warehouse). |
| **Destination (POD)** | The Point of Discharge or final delivery location. |
| **Equipment** | The type of container or wagon required (e.g., 40' High Cube, Tank Container). |
| **Commodity** | The type of goods being transported (e.g., Chemicals, Electronics, Automotive). |

## From Inquiry to Quote

The primary goal of the inquiry module is to facilitate a rapid commercial response.
1. **Route Matching**: The system automatically suggests routes designed in the **Orchestrator**.
2. **One-Click Quotation**: Generate a commercial offer by pulling data directly from the inquiry details.
3. **Performance Tracking**: Measure the time taken from initial inquiry to final quote delivery.
