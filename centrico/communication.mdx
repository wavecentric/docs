## AI-Powered Assistance

The platform uses AI to help manage the volume of communication:
- **Triage**: Automated classification of incoming messages to route them to the correct department.
- **Topic Extraction**: Identify the main subject of an email (e.g., Request for Quote, Status Update, Billing Inquiry).
- **Drafting**: Suggest response templates based on the context of the conversation.

## Operational Benefits
- **Shared Visibility**: Entire teams can see the history of communication with a customer, preventing duplicate work.
- **Audit Trail**: Every email sent and received is logged, providing a complete record for compliance and auditing.
- **Seamless Transition**: Move from a communication thread directly to creating an inquiry or a quotation with one click.
