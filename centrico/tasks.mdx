CENTRICO includes a robust task management system designed to ensure that no commercial opportunity or operational requirement is overlooked.

## Task Overview

Tasks are integrated directly into the CRM and operational workflows, allowing for seamless transitions between planning and action.

- **Manual Tasks**: Create tasks for yourself or assign them to colleagues.
- **Automated Tasks**: The system generates tasks for inquiry follow-ups, contract renewals, or missing documentation.
- **Priority Levels**: Flag urgent items to ensure they stay at the top of the queue.

## Key Features

### Contextual Linking
Every task can be linked to a specific entity within the system:
- **Customer**: Relate tasks to client meetings or profile updates.
- **Inquiry**: Track follow-ups for specific service requests.
- **Booking**: Ensure operational tasks (like document uploads) are completed on time.

### Team Collaboration
- **Assignments**: Clearly define who is responsible for each action.
- **Comments & History**: Maintain a log of progress and team discussions within the task.
- **Email Notifications**: Receive alerts when tasks are assigned to you or are approaching their deadline.

## Workflow Integration
Tasks appear in various parts of the application:
1. **Home Dashboard**: View your upcoming and overdue tasks upon login.
2. **Customer View**: See all tasks related to a specific client.
3. **Inquiry Flow**: Manage specific actions required to move an inquiry to the quotation stage.
