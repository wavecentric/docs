The **Orchestrator** provides the tools to design and manage the physical and logical logistics network that supports your commercial offers.

## Network Visualization

The core of the Orchestrator is the **Logistics Network** viewer, which allows users to see the entire reach of the service network.

- **Nodes & Hubs**: Visualize terminals, ports, and rail stations.
- **Service Traces**: See active rail, trucking, and maritime routes.
- **Connectivity Mapping**: Understand how different nodes are linked to form multimodal chains.

## Key Functionalities

### Node Management
Control the properties of every point in your network:
- **Terminal Capabilities**: Equipment, opening hours, and throughput limits.
- **Geographic Zones**: Logical grouping of nodes for pricing and routing purposes.

### Service Orchestration
Define how services are interconnected:
- **Direct Links**: Point-to-point rail or road connections.
- **Multi-stop Traces**: Complex routes involving multiple intermediate nodes.
- **Provider Management**: Link services to specific rail operators or trucking companies.

## Design to Execution

The Orchestrator acts as the "Design" layer for the MAGEMO module. Once a network is designed in the Orchestrator, it becomes available for:
1. **Quotation**: Calculating costs across defined routes.
2. **Planning**: Booking space on scheduled services.
3. **Execution**: Tracking movement through the defined nodes.
