## Inviting a New User

## Managing Pending Requests

For security, new accounts require an administrator's approval before the user can log in. This section explains the process from both the administrator's and the new user's perspectives.

### The New User's View

If a user attempts to log in before an administrator has approved their account, they will see a screen indicating that their account is pending approval.

### Administrator's Approval View

When a new user is invited, administrators will see a notification on their dashboard. The **Login Requests** tab will indicate the number of pending approvals with a red badge.

In the **Review Pending Requests** section, administrators can see a list of users awaiting access. From here, they can take one of two actions:

-   **Approve:** This action grants the user access to the platform with roles, allowing them to log in.
-   **Reject & Delete:** This action denies the request and permanently deletes the user's pending account.
