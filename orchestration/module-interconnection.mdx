The system architectural modularity allows for the rapid "plug-and-play" of functional units, ensuring that data flows without manual re-entry between departments.

## 1. The Operational Lifecycle
The application tracks the lifecycle of an intermodal transport mandate from commercial agreement to historical record.

    participant B as Booking (Commercial)
    participant P as Planning (Technical)
    participant E as Execution (Operational)
    participant M as Monitoring (Tracking)
    participant R as Admin/Reports (Analysis)

    B->>P: Confirmed Booking (Cargo, Weight, Route)
    P->>P: Assign Asset (Wagon/Vessel) via Compatibility Matrix
    P->>E: Loading Plan / Composition
    E->>E: Dispatch (CIM, Manifest, Bill of Lading)
    E->>M: Real-time Status (In Transit)
    M-->>E: Delays / Event Updates
    E->>R: Closed Workflow
    R->>R: Statistics & Financial Tonnage
```

## 2. Shared Registry Logic
Ensuring that mandatory master data from the **GENERALE** module is strictly enforced across the chain. 
- **Inbound Dependencies**: Design and Planning pull from **Soggetti** (Customers/Carriers), **Nodi** (Loading Points), and **UTI Types** (Equipment).
- **Outbound Consumer Hubs**: Design becomes Planning when a date slot is assigned; Planning becomes Execution when the physical asset moves; Execution feeds Monitoring via status updates.

## 3. Native Integration Handshakes
- **PCS Gateway**: Direct handshakes with Port Community Systems for maritime arrivals and gate notifications.
- **IM Integration**: Real-time traffic data from Infrastructure Managers for rail path management.
- **Mail Hub**: The `Modelli Mail` system resolves contacts dynamically from the **Contatti** registry based on the **Soggetto** linked to the current booking.
