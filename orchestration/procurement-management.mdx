Efficient intermodal logistics relies on a robust network of haulers and carriers. The Orchestration layer manages the vendor lifecycle from procurement to payment.

### Hauler Performance Auditing
Tracking carrier reliability and punctuality via automated KPIs. By aggregating data from the **MONITORING** module, the system can automatically rate providers based on their actual on-time performance versus planned arrivals.

### Contract Lifecycle Management
Digitizing and versioning transport agreements. Every rate, lead time, and safety requirement is stored in the Data Lake, ensuring that operational choices are always aligned with legal and commercial agreements.

### Procurement Automation
Intelligent matching of available carrier capacity with pending unit bookings. The system can suggest the most cost-effective or highest-performing hauler for a specific mission based on historical data.
