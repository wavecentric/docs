Orchestration encompasses the entire lifecycle of the customer relationship, from the first lead to the final invoice.

### Intelligent Sales Funnel
AI-assisted lead scoring and inquiry classification. The system automatically categorizes incoming requests (e.g., "Standard Rail", "Project Cargo") and assigns them to the correct commercial workflow.

### Credit Risk Integration
Direct hooks into **Creditsafe** for real-time financial vetting. Before a quote is finalized, the system checks the financial health of the **Soggetto** in the Data Lake to mitigate commercial risk.

### Automated Inquiry Fulfillment
Converting unstructured data into technical service quotes:
- **Email-to-Inquiry**: AI extracts route requirements from customer emails.
- **Route Scanning**: The system scans the active network in the Data Lake to find the most efficient path for the request.
