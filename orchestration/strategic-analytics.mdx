The Data Lake serves as a high-fidelity archive for all operational and commercial activity, enabling advanced auditing and strategic planning.

### Consolidated Financial Reporting
Merging technical costs from **MAGEMO** (fuel, track access, handling) with commercial margins from **CENTRICO**. This provides a true "Profit per Unit" view that is essential for long-term network planning.

### Tonnage & Volume Statistics
Visualizing network utilization through interactive heatmaps and time-series charts. Decision-makers can instantly identify bottleneck nodes or under-utilized services across the intermodal network.

### Operational Audit Trails
A complete, immutable history of every transaction from "Inquiry" to "Archive". Every status change, document generation, and asset assignment is logged, ensuring complete transparency for regulatory compliance and internal audits.
