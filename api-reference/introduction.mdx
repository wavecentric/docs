## Overview

The AI LooP API allows you to programmatically interact with our logistics management platform. Use the sidebar to explore endpoints for authentication, data lake access, and database operations.

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require a JSON Web Token (JWT). You can obtain a token by using the magic link authentication flow.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bearer Auth
curl --request GET \
  --url https://ai-loop.alpeadria.com/api/v1/me \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Playground

You can try out any API endpoint directly from the documentation. Simply select an endpoint from the sidebar and use the **Try It** section on the right.
