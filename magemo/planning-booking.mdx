The **PLANNING** module is where commercial commitments meet operational feasibility. It handles everything from the initial booking request to the technical finalization of a train composition.

## Booking Management

The **Booking** system is the entry point for all customer mandates. It manages the lifecycle of a transport order.

- **Fulfillment States**: Move from "Proposto" (Draft) to "Confermato" (Confirmed).
- **Multi-Unit Bookings**: A single booking can contain multiple UTIs (Containers, Swap-bodies).
- **Documentation**: Upload mandatory transport documents (CIM, CMR, BL) directly to the booking.

### Loading Units (UTI)
Manage the specific equipment assigned to each booking.
- **Inventory Check**: Verify if units are currently in stock or expected at the gate.
- **Technical Specs**: Ensure weight and dimensions comply with the service limits.

## Rail Planning & Composition

For rail operations, the system features a powerful **Train Composition** tool. This is where you assign UTIs to specific Wagons.

### The Compatibility Matrix
The **Safety Validator** of the system. It dynamically checks if a specific UTI type can be safely placed on a specific Wagon type.
- **Automatic Blocking**: If the matrix entry for a Wagon-UTI combination is empty or "forbidden", the system physically prevents the assignment.
- **Geometry Logic**: Checks for overhangs and length constraints.

### Train Dashboard
A real-time view of departures and arrivals.
- **Tonnage Aggregation**: Automatically calculates the total weight and length of the train as units are added.
- **Stability Checks**: Validates that weight distribution is within acceptable rail safety tolerances.

## Workflow: From Booking to Ready

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Booking">
    Input Customer detail, Origin/Destination, and the type of equipment (UTI).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unit Assignment">
    Assign specific Container IDs to the booking or keep them as "Generic" until terminal gate-in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wagon Mapping">
    Using the **Composition Tool**, drag and drop UTIs onto valid Wagons. The Compatibility Matrix ensures safety.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalization">
    Mark the trip as "Pronto" (Ready) to hand it over to the **Execution** teams.
  </Step>
</Steps>
