The **Zone** registry defines the spatial boundaries used to calculate transit paths and service connections.

## Key Features
- **Zone Definitions**: Grouping nodes or geographical coordinates into logical clusters.
- **Routing Logic**: Used by the **Chain Design** module to determine valid pickup and delivery perimeters.
- **Node Linking**: Associating specific terminals or warehouses with a functional zone.
