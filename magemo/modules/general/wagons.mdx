The **Carri** module is a critical safety component of the rail logistics chain, managing the physical assets and their technical constraints.

## Registry Management
- **Wagon Registry**: Individual wagon data, including UIC numbers and ownership details.
- **Wagon Types**: Classification based on length, number of axles, and loading deck height.

## Compatibility Matrix
This is a central logic hub connecting **UTI Types** to **Wagon Types**.
- **Assignment Rules**: Defines exactly which containers can be placed on which wagons.
- **Geometry Checks**: Prevents unsafe loading based on overhang or weight distribution.

## Maintenance & Archive
- **Revision Dates**: Automatic alerts when a wagon is reaching its technical maintenance deadline.
- **Cestino**: Management of archived or decommissioned rolling stock.
