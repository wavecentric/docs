The **Locodes** module provides high-speed lookup across the global **UN/LOCODE** database.

## Key Features
- **Global Standards**: Every Node in the system must be mapped to a valid UN/LOCODE to ensure interoperability with external PCS and Customs systems.
- **Search Interface**: Multi-parameter search by country, city name, and 5-letter code.
- **Consistency**: Prevents manual entry errors in terminal and port definitions.
