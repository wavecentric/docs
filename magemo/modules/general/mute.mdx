The **Mute** registry allows for the logical grouping of physical assets (Wagons/UTI) into predefined sets for easier operational planning.

## Usage
- **Shunting Groups**: Defining the "Muta" as a set of wagons that typically travel together.
- **Service Assignment**: Linking specific technical sets to frequent service rotations.
- **Fast Planning**: Allows planners to drag-and-drop an entire set into a train composition instead of individual wagons.
