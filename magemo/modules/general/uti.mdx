The **UTI** (Unità di Trasporto Intermodale) registry is the central database for all equipment types used in the logistics chain.

## Core Features
- **UTI Types**: Standardized definitions for equipment categories (e.g., 40' HC, 20' Tank, 45' PW).
- **Technical Parameters**: Tare weight, maximum load, and dimensional geometry.
- **Inventory Tracking**: Links individual unit IDs to their current status and location across the network.

## Validation Logic
- **Compatibility**: Used by the **Planning** module to verify if a specific unit can be loaded onto a target rail wagon.
- **Maintenance**: Tracking history and periodic inspection dates for equipment owned by the fleet.
