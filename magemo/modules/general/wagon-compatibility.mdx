The **Compatibility Matrix** is a core safety component of the Magemo rail orchestration layer.

## Logic Overview
This matrix defines which **UTI Types** (Containers, Tanks, etc.) are physically compatible with which **Wagon Types**.

## Technical Constraints
- **Deck Length**: Ensuring the unit doesn't exceed the available loading space.
- **Weight Limits**: Comparing the gross weight of the UTI against the load capacity per axle of the wagon.
- **Safety Locking**: Defining the standard pin positions for secure transport.
