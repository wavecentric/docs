## 1. Overview
The reporting engine provides deep insights into the database using predefined templates for common logistics KPIs. It transforms raw operational events into structured data for client billing, carrier auditing, and management oversight.

## 2. Technical Field Mapping (Report Soste)
The **Soste** (Storage) report is the primary tool for administrative terminal validation.

| Field | Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Codice UTI** | Inventory | The physical unit identification. |
| **Sosta (GG/HH)** | Calculation | Duration between Gate-In and Gate-Out. |
| **Inizio / Fine Sosta**| Monitoring | The validated timestamps of entry and exit. |
| **Validato Il** | Manual | Administrative audit timestamp. |

### Capabilities
*   **Batch Save**: Operators can perform inline validation of records (e.g., checking storage days) and commit changes in bulk using the **Salva dati report** function.
*   **Recalculation**: The **Ricalcola** button allows for a manual refresh of the calculation engine if timestamps are corrected after the event.
*   **Data Consistency**: All filters are dynamically linked to the **GENERALE** module master registries, ensuring that reports stay aligned with current subjects and nodes.
