## 1. Overview
**Rail Planning** is the strategic interface for train construction. It provides operators with the tools to translate commercial bookings into technically feasible and safe rail compositions.

## 2. Technical Field Mapping (Elenco Treni)

The departures/arrivals list serves as the primary dashboard for rail coordinators.

## 3. The "Tetris" View: Loading Logic
The core of the module is the **Composition Tool**, where planners perform the following manual and automated tasks:
*   **Wagon Consist Builder**: Dragging technical wagons from the registry into the train sequence.
*   **Unit Placement**: Assigning UTIs from the "Bookings to Load" queue onto specific wagon positions.
*   **Automated Validation**: The system cross-references the **Compatibility Matrix** (Weight, Profile, UTI Type) in real-time. If a combination is unsafe, the system blocks the assignment.

*   **Inbound**: Pulls technical path limits (Max Weight/Length) from **DESIGN** and asset availability from **GENERALE**.
*   **Outbound**: Confirmed train configurations feed the **EXECUTION** module's manifest generation and trigger data synchronization with **Port Community Systems (PCS)**.
