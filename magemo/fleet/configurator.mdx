## 1. Overview

**Zig Zag Configurator** (Generation of Railway Graphs) empowers users to dynamically model logistics networks. It fulfills the requirement to generate railway graphs that allow operators to run simulations and evaluate different "what-if" scenarios based on different logistics options.

This capability is essential for testing hypothetical network configurations before implementation.

## 2. Scope and Business Meaning

Functionally, this module covers the **Network Modeling & Simulation** layer. It ensures:
*   **Dynamic Graph Creation**: Building new logistics graphs on-the-fly based on user configuration.
*   **Scenario Testing**: Evaluating how a new rail link or terminal would impact the broader network.
*   **Option Comparison**: Running simulations on these generated graphs to compare costs, times, and feasibility against existing infrastructure.

## 3. Implemented Functionalities

The platform implements "Railway Graph Generation" through **Zig Zag** within the **Orchestrator** module.

### Graph Construction
The **Zig Zag** tool allows users to visually construct complex railway paths:
*   **Node Linking**: Users can link distinct network nodes (terminals, hubs) to create a custom "train graph."
*   **Visual Validation**: The interface provides immediate visual feedback on the connectivity and validity of the proposed rail segments.

### Simulation & Analysis
Once a graph is generated via Zig Zag, it becomes an input for the simulation engine:
*   **Logistics Options**: The system evaluates distinct logistics variables (different providers, timetables) on this newly generated topology.

## 4. Technical Enablement

The platform enables this deliverable through:

### Dynamic Topology Engine
*   **Graph-in-Memory**: The system creates temporary, in-memory graph structures that exist solely for the user's session, allowing for "what-if" experimentation without polluting the production database.
*   **Orchestrator Integration**: The generated graph is natively understood by the Orchestrator's routing algorithms, meaning all standard optimization logic applies immediately to the new configuration.

## 5. Navigation
*   **Menu Path**: `Fleet Management > Zig Zag`
