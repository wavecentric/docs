Once the planning phase is complete, the **EXECUTION** and **MONITORING** modules take over to manage the physical movement of goods and provide 24/7 visibility.

## Operational Execution

Execution is divided by transport mode, each with specialized toolsets:

### Rail Operations
- **Train Dispatch**: Manage departure and arrival events with real-time timestamps.
- **Manifest Generation**: Generate technical train documents for Infrastructure Managers.
- **PCS Integration**: Automated electronic handshakes with Port Community Systems for maritime-rail combined flows.

### Trucking Operations
- **Mission Mandates**: Generate and send transport orders to haulers.
- **Last-Mile Tracking**: Monitor road legs of intermodal journeys.

### Maritime Operations
- **Vessel Tracking**: Manage calls at port and vessel schedules.
- **EDI Exchange**: Automated COPARN/COARRI messaging for loading/unloading operations.

## Monitoring & Visibility

The **Monitoring** module provides a "Control Tower" view of all active assets.

### Track & Trace (IoT)
Magemo integrates directly with IoT providers (like Nexxiot and Savvy) to pull live GPS and shock data.
- **Geofencing**: Automated status updates when a wagon or container enters/leaves a defined node.
- **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)**: Dynamic calculation based on real-time speed and position.

### UTI Inventory
Management of equipment status at various terminals.
- **Gate-In / Gate-Out**: Log physical movements of units entering or leaving the system.
- **Empty vs Full**: Real-time balance of available equipment for future bookings.
- **Transits**: Track units moving through hub nodes without long-term storage.

## Integration Layer

Execution and Monitoring work in tandem with external technical systems:

| System Type | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PCS** | Electronic pre-billing and gate-authorizations at ports. |
| **IM (Infrastructure)** | Technical path booking and rail capacity management. |
| **GPS Hub** | Aggregated data from multiple fleet tracking providers. |

## The "Pronto" to "Chiuso" Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Operational Start">
    The trip moves from "Planning" to "Execution" when the assets are physically verified.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Live Tracking">
    The Monitoring module updates the trip status automatically based on GPS geofencing or terminal gate events.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Event Management">
    Operations teams manage delays, transhipment exceptions, and documentation updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Closure">
    Once the final node is reached, the trip is marked as "Chiuso" (Closed), triggering the billing process in the Admin module.
  </Step>
