The **DESIGN** module is the engineering core of Magemo. It allows you to define the "possible" routes and services that your commercial teams can sell and your operational teams can execute.

## Core Entities

### 1. Transport Services
A **Service** is a commercial product offering. It defines *what* you are selling (e.g., "North-South Terminal Express").
- **Commercial Validity**: Services have start and end dates.
- **Categorization**: Group services by type (Intermodal, Conventional, Door-to-Door).
- **Billing Logic**: Set flags for automated invoicing integration.

### 2. Physical Traces
A **Trace** (Traccia) is the technical blueprint of a rail or road movement. It defines the "slot" in time and space.
- **Node-to-Node**: Every trace links an Origin Node to a Destination Node.
- **Schedule Templates**: Define standard departure/arrival times and days of the week.
- **Agency Links**: Associate traces with specific Infrastructure Managers (IMs) or Carriers.

### 3. Service Connections
**Connections** are the bridges between commercial demand (Services) and technical supply (Traces). They represent specific "Generators" for daily trips.
- **Trip Generation**: Automatically generate daily instances of a trip based on connection templates.
- **Transhipment Windows**: Define allowed time windows for connecting one leg of a journey to another.

## Operational Logic: The Design Chain

The design phase follows a strict hierarchy to ensure data integrity:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Nodes">
    Ensure all Terminals, Ports, and Depots are defined in the **Generale** module with correct geographic coordinates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engineer Traces">
    Create the technical paths between nodes. A trace defines the travel time and the physical capacity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Services">
    Create the commercial product that will be offered to clients, linking it to the required nodes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Establish Connections">
    Link the Commercial Service to the Technical Trace to enable the **Planning** module to start accepting bookings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Visualizing the Network

Service design is not just a table of data; it's a visual network. By linking nodes through traces, the system builds an interactive map of your operational reach, shared with the **Orchestrator** module in Centrico for commercial planning.
