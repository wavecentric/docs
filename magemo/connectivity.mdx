## 1. The Operational Lifecycle
The application tracks the lifecycle of an intermodal transport mandate from its inception as a commercial agreement to its closure as a historical record.

```mermaid

    participant B as Booking (Commercial)
    participant P as Planning (Technical)
    participant E as Execution (Operational)
    participant M as Monitoring (Tracking)
    participant R as Admin/Reports (Analysis)

    B->>P: Confirmed Booking (Cargo, Weight, Route)
    P->>P: Assign Asset (Wagon/Vessel) via Compatibility Matrix
    P->>E: Loading Plan / Composition
    E->>E: Dispatch (CIM, Manifest, Bill of Lading)
    E->>M: Real-time Status (In Transit)
    M-->>E: Delays / Event Updates
    E->>R: Closed Workflow
    R->>R: Statistics & Financial Tonnage
```

## 2. Core Entity Relationship
How the "General" module drives the rest of the system.

```mermaid

    SOGGETTI ||--o{ NAVI : owns
    TIPI-NAVE ||--o{ NAVI : classifies
    TIPI-CARRO ||--o{ CARRI : classifies
    TIPI-CARRO ||--o{ COMPATIBILITA-MATRIX : defines-Y
    TIPI-UTI ||--o{ COMPATIBILITA-MATRIX : defines-X
    NODI ||--o{ ZONE : groups
    NODI ||--o{ BOOKING : targets
    CARRI ||--o{ MUTE : bundles
    MERCI ||--o{ BOOKING : describes
```

## 3. External Ecosystem & Integrations
The system does not operate in a vacuum. It acts as a central hub for multiple external stakeholders and technical systems.

```mermaid

    subgraph "External Systems"

        IM[Infrastructure Manager]
        ERP[Financial ERP]
    end
    
    subgraph "Core Platform"
        EXEC[Execution Module]
        PLAN[Planning Module]
        ADM[Admin Module]
    end
    
    subgraph "Mobile"
        APP[Driver App]
    end

    EXEC <-->|EDI/COPARN| PCS
    EXEC <-->|Web-CIM| IM
    ADM -->|Invoicing Data| ERP
    EXEC <-->|Push/Milestones| APP
```

## 4. Key Connectivity Rules
1. **The Safety Validator**: The **Wagon/UTI Compatibility Matrix** is the fundamental rulebook. No cargo (UTI) can be loaded onto an asset (Wagon) without an explicit "Pass" from this matrix.
2. **The Notification Hub**: The **Modelli Mail** system resolves contacts dynamically from the **Contatti** registry based on the **Soggetto** linked to the current booking.
3. **Master Data Dependency**: Every operational transaction (a "Viaggio" or "Booking") is strictly a pointer to the **Master Data** module. Modifications in "General" (e.g., updating a Wagon's weight limit) propagate immediately to the **Planning Engine**.

## 5. Critical Data Points
- **IMO Number**: The universal key for Maritime tracking.
- **Matricola**: The unique key for Rail assets.
- **ISO Size Type**: The standardization key for Cargo dimensions.
- **LoCode**: The international key for geographic Nodes.
