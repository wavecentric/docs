The **GENERALE** module is the "Single Source of Truth" for the entire Magemo ecosystem. No operational movement can occur without validating against the Master Data registry.

## Core Registries

### 1. Subjects (Soggetti) & Contacts
Management of every legal entity involved in the logistics chain.
- **Roles**: Categorize subjects as Customers, Carriers, MTOs, or Agents.
- **Dynamic Mailing**: Link contacts to specific functional roles (e.g., "Operations", "Finance") to automate communication flows.

### 2. Network Nodes (Nodi)
Physical locations where logistics events occur.
- **Terminal Capabilities**: Define equipment and storage limits.
- **Geographic Zones**: Link nodes to logical zones for pricing and routing logic.
- **Locode Search**: Integrated UN/LOCODE database for standardization.

### 3. Equipment & Fleet
Detailed technical specifications for physical assets:
- **UTI (Units)**: Container types, dimensions, and weight thresholds.
- **Wagons (Carri)**: Rail specifications, length, tara, and maintenance status.
- **Ships (Navi)**: Vessel registry for maritime legs.

### 4. Fleet Management (Zig-Zag)
A specialized view for managing wagon availability and technical status in real-time.
- **Status Monitoring**: Tracks if wagons are in service, under maintenance, or empty.
- **Condition Grading**: Visualize fleet health using colored indicators (White, Yellow, Green).

## System Administration

### Configuration & Templates
- **Mail Models**: Design HTML templates for automated operational notifications (e.g., "Booking Confirmed").
- **Mail Parameters**: Global SMTP settings and dynamic field resolvers.
- **Commodities**: Registry of goods types and hazardous materials classifications.

## Data Governance

To maintain "Clean Data", the system follows strict governance rules:
- **No Ad-hoc Entries**: Fields like "Node" or "Wagon" in the Planning module are strictly restricted to search-and-select from the Master Data.
- **Audit Logs**: Changes to critical technical parameters (like wagon length or UTI capacity) are logged for auditing.
- **Validation Rules**: Mandatory fields and regex validation ensure data entry consistency across different teams.
