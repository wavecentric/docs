Effective user management is key to maintaining a secure and organized workspace. In AI Loop, all user administration tasks are handled by users with the **Admin** role. Admins are responsible for inviting new users, assigning roles, and managing the team roster.

- Invite new users to the workspace.
- Assign and change roles for other users.
- Remove users from the workspace.

## Role-Based Access Control

AI Loop uses a role-based system to ensure that users can only access the data and tools relevant to their job. When inviting a user or editing their profile, an Admin must assign one of the following roles.
